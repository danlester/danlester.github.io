Congratulations to Amiri Health, a startup applying the latest computer vision techniques to detect prostate cancer through MRI scans, for unveiling their research publicly in the Cambridge Independent.

I worked with Antony earlier this year, helping to build deep learning models plus relevant pipelines and tools.
