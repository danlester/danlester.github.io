title: Converting Jupyter Notebooks to Excel spreadsheets
---

I am pleased to announce the release of [nb2xls](https://github.com/ideonate/nb2xls): Convert Jupyter notebooks to Excel Spreadsheets, through a new 'Download As' option or via nbconvert on the command line.

Respects tables such as Pandas DataFrames. Also exports image data such as matplotlib output.

Markdown is supported where possible (some elements still need work).

Input (code) cells are not included in the spreadsheet.

This allows you to share your results with non-programmers such that they can still easily play with the data.

More details on the motivation for this project can be found in my article in Towards Data Science: [Jupyter is the new Excel (but not for your boss)](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-is-the-new-excel-but-not-for-your-boss-d24340ebf314)
